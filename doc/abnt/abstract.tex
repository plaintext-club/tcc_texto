\hspace*{3em}
The communication technologies changed the way people live by allowing them to connect to each other through easy to carry and easy to use electronic devices such as computers and smartphones.
Once proven the efficiency and convenience of those devices, their use got expanded to include communication with systems of different purposes located at supermarkets, malls and hospitals.
Therefore, research in this field of connected device are of great value for people and businesses.
The use of these devices are not limited to driving electric loads and can even reach the fields of mass data analysis (Big Data) and Artificial Intelligence.
This model of connected devices is called IoT (Internet of Things) and is the base for our project, which aims to develop a system to ease the use of connected devices for the end user, with a friendly user interface for control without dependencies on third party solutions and without requiring a lot of knowledge in programming and electronics from the user.
The methods used to create this solution were chosen based in pragmatism, efficiency and applicability of the tools and mainly in the knowledge acquired during the graduation.
